# Muninn
 Muninn is a web app based around procedurally generating study material in several forms from the pdf of any book, chapter or other educational text. It uses the gemini API to generate flashcards according to the supplied text and can also generate unique tests based on the same material, as well as grade them and provide constructive feedback. Muninn had started off as a project for fun, but was later used for the MU20 Hackathon where it won a special commendation. This was my first time ever trying out web development which was a rather stupid decision, but also quite fun because I got to learn django and a bit of HTML and CSS
